About Dataset
Data Set Information:
The dataset comprised wheat kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each. The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.All of these parameters were real-valued continuous

Attribute Information:
To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured:

area A,
perimeter P,
compactness C = 4piA/P^2,
length of kernel,
width of kernel,
asymmetry coefficient
length of kernel groove.
